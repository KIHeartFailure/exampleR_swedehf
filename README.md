# Simple R code to get started using SwedeHF (SHFDB4)

## Language 

English. 

## Data

The data consists of individual patient data and is not public, 
and therefore no data is stored in this repository. The examples use rsdata4xx.RData

## Instructions

Load the SwedeHF data into your workspace, load("xx/rsdata4xx.RData"), and run the examples. 

Always check if the code generated the required result!
